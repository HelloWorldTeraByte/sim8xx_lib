# sim8xx_lib
SIM808 GSM shield library for STM32 ARM Cortex M 4 microcontroller. But should work with most ARM microcontrollers assuming if you changed the registers. This should also work for most of the SIMxx GSM modules. This is a part of a original project, that I am making public, incase if anyone finds it usefull.
